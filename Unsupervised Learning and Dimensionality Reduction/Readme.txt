README


All the algorithms were implemented in MATLAB
All the files are under MATLAB folder

1. To run all algorithms for Iris Flower Dataset
	run fisheriris.m

	To run a particular algorithm, comment out other algorithms


2. To run all algorithms on Leaf Dataset
	run leaf.m


3. To run Neural Network
	run NN_leaf.m

	By default NN runs for original data. If you want to run NN for particular case, remove the comments of the corresponding case.
